<h1>Introduction</h1>
<p><code>liboai</code> is a simple, <b>unofficial</b> C++17 library for the OpenAI API. It allows developers to access OpenAI endpoints through a simple collection of methods and classes.

It can most efficiently be thought of as a <b>spiritual port</b> of OpenAI's Python library, simply called <code>openai</code>, due to its similar structure--with few exceptions. See below for just how similar in style <code>liboai</code> and its Python alternative are when generating an image using DALL-E.</p>

```py
import openai
import os

openai.api_key = os.getenv("OPENAI_API_KEY")
response = openai.Image.create(
    prompt="A snake in the grass!",
    n=1,
    size="256x256"
)
print(response["data"][0]["url"])
```

```cpp
#include "liboai.h"

using namespace liboai;

int main() {
  OpenAI oai;
  oai.auth.SetKeyEnv("OPENAI_API_KEY");
	
  Response res = oai.Image->create(
    "A snake in the grass!",
    1,
    "256x256"
  );

  std::cout << res["data"][0]["url"] << std::endl;
}
```
